# Outlier-Detection-Removal

Detecting and handling outliers is a crucial step in data preprocessing to ensure the quality and reliability of statistical analyses. Here are some notes on how to detect and remove outliers using various methods:

Mean Function:
Detecting outliers using the mean function involves calculating the mean (average) of the data points and identifying values that significantly deviate from this mean. Outliers can be defined as data points that lie beyond a certain number of standard deviations from the mean. To remove outliers using the mean function, you can simply exclude data points that fall outside a predetermined range, such as those beyond ±3 standard deviations from the mean.

Percentile Method:
The percentile method involves calculating percentiles, such as the 25th and 75th percentiles (also known as the first and third quartiles, respectively), and using them to define a range within which most of the data points lie. Outliers can be identified as data points that fall below the lower percentile (e.g., 25th percentile - 1.5 * interquartile range) or above the higher percentile (e.g., 75th percentile + 1.5 * interquartile range). Data points outside this range can be considered outliers and removed from the dataset.

IQR (Interquartile Range) Method:
The Interquartile Range (IQR) method is closely related to the percentile method and is often used in conjunction with it. The IQR is calculated as the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). Outliers are identified as data points lying below Q1 - 1.5 * IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 * IQR. Data points falling outside this range are considered outliers and can be removed.

Normal Distribution:
Assuming the data follows a normal distribution, outliers can be detected using statistical measures such as z-scores. A z-score measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean of the distribution. Typically, data points with z-scores greater than a certain threshold (e.g., ±3) are considered outliers and can be removed from the dataset.

Z-Score Method:
The z-score method is a specific application of the normal distribution approach. To detect outliers using z-scores, calculate the z-score for each data point based on the mean and standard deviation of the dataset. Data points with z-scores exceeding a predefined threshold (e.g., ±3) are considered outliers and can be removed. In summary, these methods provide different approaches to detect and remove outliers from a dataset, and the choice of method depends on factors such as the distribution of the data and the specific requirements of the analysis.
